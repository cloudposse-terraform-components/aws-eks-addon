# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This component is responsible for installing and managing addons for EKS clusters.

  You may want to use this component rather than `var.addons` with `eks/cluster` to deploy addons that require additional
  prerequisites or configuration before they can be installed. For example, if you need to install a priority class before
  installing an addon, you can use this component to install the priority class first.

usage: |-
  **Stack Level**: Regional

  For example, to install the CloudWatch Observability addon for EKS:

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/install-CloudWatch-Observability-EKS-addon.html
      eks/addon/cloudwatch:
        metadata:
          component: eks/addon
        vars:
          addon_name: amazon-cloudwatch-observability
          addon_version: "v2.5.0-eksbuild.1"
          kubernetes_namespace: amazon-cloudwatch # this namespace is defined by the addon
          resolve_conflicts_on_create: OVERWRITE
          resolve_conflicts_on_update: OVERWRITE
          priority_class_enabled: true
          additional_policy_arns:
            - "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy"
  ```
